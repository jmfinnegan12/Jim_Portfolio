# [Project 1: 1-D Transport Model](https://github.com/jmfinnegan12/1Dtransport)
### Groundwater Modeling, Tufts University
- built models for 1-D solute transport in porous medium using python
- Crank-Nicholson centered finite difference scheme
- Galerkin finite element method 
- Compared the models to the analytical solution for various initial conditions and parameters

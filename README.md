#### I am passionate about statistics and data science, particularly their applications to my undergraduate background: engineering and earth science. I built on my introductory undergraduate computer science courses with self-teaching and independent projects that are showcased in this portfolio. I implement computational skills and numerical methods using Python, MATLAB, and ArcGIS. I have taught myself statistical and computer skills including data scraping, object oriented programming, and data anlysis and visualization. I am always working on building new skills and tackling exciting new projects

# Numerical Methods - Python
## [1-D Solute Transport Model](https://github.com/jmfinnegan12/1Dtransport)
#### Groundwater Modeling, Tufts University
- built models for 1-D solute transport in porous medium using python
- Crank-Nicholson centered finite difference scheme
- Galerkin finite element method 
- Compared the models to the analytical solution for various initial conditions and parameters

# Text Recognition and Processing - Python
#### Independent projects to improve productivity at work
[full repo](https://github.com/jmfinnegan12/pdf)
## [PDF Table Reader](https://github.com/jmfinnegan12/pdf/blob/main/TableReader_finalized.ipynb)
- built a program to scrape tables from PDF documents
- converts tables to pandas dataframe, excel, or csv
- saved hours preventing the need to manually transcribe tables--possibility for future expansion and industry-disrupting results


## [PDF Highlighter](https://github.com/jmfinnegan12/pdf/blob/main/PDF%20Highlight.ipynb)
- built a program to highlight text on a PDF with over 3,000 labels
- provides accurate, up to date production tracking for a $1.8 million project

# GIS - ArcMAP
## [Avalanche Risk Analysis](https://github.com/jmfinnegan12/avalanche)
#### Geological Applications of GIS, Tufts University
- Reached the final round of 20 out of over 250 posters in Tufts University GIS poster session
- Synthesized several publically available datasets
- Created a comprehensive risk analysis using GIS methods including raster analysis, reclassification, and intersection

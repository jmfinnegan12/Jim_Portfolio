#### I have a background in civil engineering and earth science, and I am passionate about statistics and data science. I built on my introductory undergraduate computer science courses with self-teaching and independent projects that are showcased in this portfolio. I implement computational skills, data analysis and visualization, and numerical methods using Python, MATLAB, and ArcGIS. I am always working on building new skills and tackling exciting new projects


# [1-D Solute Transport Model](https://github.com/jmfinnegan12/1Dtransport)
### Groundwater Modeling, Tufts University
- built models for 1-D solute transport in porous medium using python
- Crank-Nicholson centered finite difference scheme
- Galerkin finite element method 
- Compared the models to the analytical solution for various initial conditions and parameters

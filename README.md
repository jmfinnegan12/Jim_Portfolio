#### I am passionate about statistics and data science, particularly their applications to my undergraduate background: engineering and earth science. I built on my introductory undergraduate computer science courses with self-teaching and independent projects that are showcased in this portfolio. I implement computational skills and numerical methods using Python, MATLAB, and ArcGIS. I have taught myself statistical and computer skills including data scraping, object oriented programming, and data anlysis and visualization. I am always working on building new skills and tackling exciting new projects


# [1-D Solute Transport Model](https://github.com/jmfinnegan12/1Dtransport)
### Groundwater Modeling, Tufts University
- built models for 1-D solute transport in porous medium using python
- Crank-Nicholson centered finite difference scheme
- Galerkin finite element method 
- Compared the models to the analytical solution for various initial conditions and parameters
